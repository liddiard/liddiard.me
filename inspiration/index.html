      <h2>If&mdash;</h2>
      <h3 class="author">Rudyard Kipling</h3>
      <p>If you can keep your head when all about you <br /> Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, <br />If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br /> But make allowance for their doubting too; <br />If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br /> Or being lied about, don&rsquo;t deal in lies,<br />Or being hated, don&rsquo;t give way to hating,<br /> And yet don&rsquo;t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
      <p>If you can dream&mdash;and not make dreams your master; <br /> If you can think&mdash;and not make thoughts your aim; <br />If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br /> And treat those two impostors just the same; <br />If you can bear to hear the truth you&rsquo;ve spoken<br /> Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br /> And stoop and build &rsquo;em up with worn-out tools:</p>
      <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br /> And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br /> And never breathe a word about your loss;<br />If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br /> To serve your turn long after they are gone, <br />And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br /> Except the Will which says to them: &lsquo;Hold on!&rsquo;</p>
      <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, <br /> Or walk with Kings&mdash;nor lose the common touch,<br />If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br /> If all men count with you, but none too much;<br />If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br /> With sixty seconds&rsquo; worth of distance run, <br />Yours is the Earth and everything that&rsquo;s in it, <br /> And&mdash;which is more&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be a Man, my son!</p>

      <h2>It Couldn&rsquo;t Be Done</h2>
      <h3 class="author">Edgar A. Guest</h3>
      <p>Somebody said that it couldn&rsquo;t be done<br /> But he with a chuckle replied<br />That &ldquo;maybe it couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; but he would be one<br /> Who wouldn&rsquo;t say so till he&rsquo;d tried.<br />So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin<br /> On his face. If he worried he hid it.<br />He started to sing as he tackled the thing<br /> That couldn&rsquo;t be done, and he did it!</p>
      <p>Somebody scoffed: &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll never do that;<br /> At least no one ever has done it;&rdquo;<br />But he took off his coat and he took off his hat<br /> And the first thing we knew he&rsquo;d begun it.<br />With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,<br /> Without any doubting or quiddit,<br />He started to sing as he tackled the thing<br /> That couldn&rsquo;t be done, and he did it.</p>
      <p>There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,<br /> There are thousands to prophesy failure,<br />There are thousands to point out to you one by one,<br /> The dangers that wait to assail you.<br />But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,<br /> Just take off your coat and go to it;<br />Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing<br /> That &ldquo;cannot be done,&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll do it.</p>

      <h2>Invictus</h2>
      <h3 class="author">William Ernest Henley</h3>
      <p>Out of the night that covers me,<br /> Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br />I thank whatever gods may be<br /> For my unconquerable soul.</p>
      <p>In the fell clutch of circumstance<br /> I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br />Under the bludgeonings of chance<br /> My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>
      <p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br /> Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br />And yet the menace of the years<br /> Finds and shall find me unafraid.</p>
      <p>It matters not how strait the gate,<br /> How charged with punishments the scroll,<br />I am the master of my fate,<br /> I am the captain of my soul.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I must not fear.</p>
      <p>Fear is the mind-killer.</p>
      <p>Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.</p>
      <p>I will face my fear.</p>
      <p>I will permit it to pass over me and through me.</p>
      <p>And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.</p>
      <p>Where the fear has gone there will be nothing....only I will remain.&rdquo;</p>

  <section id="pale-blue-dot">
      <p>Consider again that dot. That&rsquo;s here. That&rsquo;s home. That&rsquo;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &ldquo;superstar,&rdquo; every &ldquo;supreme leader,&rdquo; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there &ndash; on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>
      <p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity &ndash; in all this vastness &ndash; there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.</p>
      <p>The Earth is the only world known, so far, to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.</p>
