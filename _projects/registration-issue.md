For *Daily Bruin*'s inaugural issue of the academic year, I worked with the news, photo, arts & entertainment, and video sections of the paper to create several online features.

The features included an interactive satellite map of the campus residence halls to show construction improvements over the years, a photo gallery from *The Bruin*'s studio shoot of UCLA athletes, and an interactive map of video stories from places around LA. 

All these features were tied together on an highly visual landing page that was featured on the main page of site.
