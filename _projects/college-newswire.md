In late 2013, *Daily Bruin* spearheaded a partnership with other collegiate newspapers to share content among the participating organizations.

To make stories easily accessible for members, I created a site which uses Google's Feed API and JavaScript to aggregate the RSS feeds of participating organizations. It determines articles' proper categorization, orders all posts by time published, and filters out content older than an arbitrary number of days old.

I designed the site with a modern but newspaper-like feel â€“ monochrome with large, serif headers on a light background.
